# Changelog

## Unreleased
### Use the new reboot-log API
- Device reboot data now comes from `getDeviceRebootLogs`, which returns one object
  per reboot instead of one row per field. The old `getDeviceErrorLogs` event is
  deprecated but still served, so older versions of this integration keep working.
- **Requires OnlyCat gateway 2026-07-31 or later.** Do not release ahead of it.
- The `errors` attribute on the device-errors sensor changes shape:
  `{deviceId, timestamp, build, cause, isError, summary, detail, message}` instead of
  `{time, deviceId, measureName, message}`. Automations reading `message` are
  unaffected; those reading `time` should read `timestamp`.
- `build`, `cause`, `isError`, `summary` and `detail` are newly available. A null
  means the firmware of the day did not report it, not that the value was false or
  zero — `cause`, `summary` and `isError` exist for reboots from 2026-03-21, and
  `build` from 2026-07-14.
- The sensor still turns on for any reboot in the polling window. Distinguishing a
  crash from a clean requested reboot using `isError` is deliberately left as a
  separate change, since it would alter what existing automations fire on.
