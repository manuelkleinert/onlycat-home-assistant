# OnlyCat Integration for Home Assistant

HomeAssistant integration for [OnlyCat](https://www.onlycat.com/) flaps.

## Features

* 🏠 Know whether your pet is home or on the hunt using the Device Tracker
  * 🕒 Know when your pet was last seen by the device, whether it transited or not
  * 🐾 In case your pet chooses another exit, you can override the presence using the `set_pet_location` service
* 🔎 Keep track of your device and build automations with it using binary sensors for:
   * 📶 Flap connection status
   * 🕒 Flap events (including timestamps, RFID codes, trigger source, and event classification)
   * 🐭 Contraband detection
   * 🔐 Lock state
   * 👤 Human detection
   * ⚠️ Device errors
   * 🎥 Last activity video and image
* 🚪 Manage the active door policy manually or using automations
* 📋 View and change door policy information via sensors and the `update_device_policy` service
* 🔄 Control your flap remotely using reboot and remote unlock buttons
* Check and manage your existing device policies

Common automation ideas enabled by this integration include:

* 🚨 Switch the door policy to "Locked" for a longer time period than usual when contraband is detected
* 💦 Deter intruders by triggering a sprinkler when an unknown RFID code is detected
* 🧹 Start your robot vacuum when your pet leaves the house
* 😻 Roll out the red carpet for your pet by activating welcome lights or triggering a feeder upon arrival
